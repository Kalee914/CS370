â€¢	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, The Treasure Hunt Game, the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. I have designed an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate navigates the environment, finds different pathways, and circumvents obstacles to find the treasure. I was provided with a starter code, which included the environment, experience for replay, build model, and play game function; my part was to create the Q-Training Algorithm. The objective of my algorithm is to determine the optimal sequence of navigation to achieve the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. 


o	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

AI and ML Computer scientists develop algorithms that can analyze large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions. Their work matters because algorithms can maximize their potential to use resources and technology to solve complex problems in today's world. 

o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I would approach problem-adapting methodologies. First, I need to understand the context of the requirement and constraint to design an algorithm that fits the needs of the specification. Secondly, security and privacy measures should be prioritized to protect data from vulnerabilities and attacks, such as implementing encryption, authentication, and access control. Moreover, a scalable system should be designed to handle increased workload and maintain performance. Lastly, thorough testing must be conducted to validate the performance and continuously optimize algorithms and protocols based on feedback. 

o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist include navigating ethics by embedding principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability into AI systems. This includes designing algorithms that mitigate bias, ensuring data privacy through secure protocols, and protecting user rights to maintain ethical standards.
